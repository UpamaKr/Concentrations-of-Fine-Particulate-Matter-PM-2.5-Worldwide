# Concentrations-of-Fine-Particulate-Matter-PM-2.5-Worldwide

Global PM (2.5) Concentrations: A GIS Analysis Using Python and the Latest WHO Ambient Air Quality Database.

In this part of the project, Python and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are utilized to analyze and visualize the global distribution of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5). The latest data from the WHO Ambient Air Quality Database is used for this purpose. The visualization is a choropleth map, created with the Mercator projection. This work contributes to the understanding of air quality and its implications for public health.
